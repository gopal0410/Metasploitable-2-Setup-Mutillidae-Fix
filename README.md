*   Changed the network adapter to Bridged mode to enable network access.

## Verified that Metasploitable services and hosted websites were accessible via a browser.

*   Accessed the Mutillidae II web application and tested its functionality.

*   Encountered a database error while attempting to log in.

*   Identified and fixed the database configuration issue.

*   Re-tested Mutillidae II to confirm it was working correctly without errors.

## Verification

*   The following were verified as part of this project:
